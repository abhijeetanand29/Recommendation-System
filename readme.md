### American Express (Amex) has a system called "Merchant Recommender."
### The purpose of this system is to recommend personalized merchants (shops that accept Amex cards) to Amex credit card customers.
### The goal of recommending these merchants is to help customers discover nearby shops and increase their spending on those merchants.
### The recommendations are made using an algorithm.
## If a customer makes a transaction at a recommended merchant within 30 days of receiving the recommendation, it's considered a "successful activation."
